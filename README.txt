This is a simple python script that downloads the first picture from the top of (timeframe) from the subreddit of your choice and sets it as your desktop wallpaper. To run, you will need Python3 installed on your computer and administrative rights on your user account.


The default settings in the args.ini file are set to download the top post of the week from www.reddit.com/r/SpacePorn but can be changed to your liking. Further, the "number" argument is how many of the top posts this script will try to download before quitting. This is useful on a sub that is heavy with text posts but still allows links.


Enjoy!
